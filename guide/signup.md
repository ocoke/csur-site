# Sign up to CranSurvey

After deploying your CranSurvey site, you need to sign up for an account with a username and a password.

By the way, the username and password are stored in your database. So the account can't sign in with other CranSurvey sites in different databases.

Visit: `https://[your-domain]/sign-up` to sign up.
