## Layout

First, you need to choose a layout for your survey.

There are three layouts for your survey, they are `Simple`, `Advanced` and `Prompt`.

- `Simple`: Simple Survey only includes one question, if you want to add it to your website, users don't need to open another prompt window to answer your questions.
- `Advanced`: You can add several questions here and share them with a link easily. If you want to add it to your website, users will still stay on the page but there will be a prompt window for users to answer them.
- `Prompt`: There are no questions and the page will only include a paragraph of text.
